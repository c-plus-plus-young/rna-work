RNA seq is when you extract RNA from cells, then read it
 - File of sequences of DNA letters AUGC
 - Based on the cells under different conditions
    - High/low heat, virus from wild or infecting someone
 - Sorted in different colors 

In .tsv or .csv format
 - combine all experiments together, each column one experiment (0 if not found in experiment) - top row named gene
    - Each row a different sequence

Second file is combination of others
 - first two are name, last is name with .tar.gz
 - Third is type of experiment, (control, type
of treatment)

Use count_matrix (raw data) .txt file, not BED format or normalized

- two samples from one cell, 

Some genes (rows) have X, are just a number (or gene000), or DNA sequences, remove them
 - other formats of file may have raw counts

If entire file contains them, mark as generic

Up to Escherichia_coli (pink column two (M) has been done

Must have gene IDs, or not usable

Keep track of time spent

24 experiments left in 2nd column (try to finish by Wednesday)


DISCORD:
Transform all files (single or multiple files) into comma separated file with read (transcript/RNA molecule) counts, and it should be named as counts.txt. The first column must be named as Gene.
If there are repeated IDs, but it's an X, get rid of the X rows. If there are multiple repeated IDs, let me know.
If the IDs are just a number or gene###, ignore that and color the cell in the Excel file.
Accepted IDs would be gene symbols like PLAGL1,  AGPAT4, or ENSEMBL IDs like ENSOARG00020003627 (they start with ENS always).
If the numbers are float (unless it's .0) instead of integers, then it's not usable. Color them as well. 
There might be multiple files for download. They must be TXT/CSV/TSV. Some of them might be the normalized/FPKM/TPM/RPKM version and, in the same experiment, there might be the file with the actual raw counts.
Start from Gallus gallus vs Marek's disease virus (row 286), second column.
Some experiments might be found in other rows too. If so, you only need to do the conversion once.
Skip colored cells.
